          "Hi, my name is Pat. I'm a web engineer based in sunny Orange County, California. Some of my favorite aspects of software engineering are making large-scale apps and tools, npm packages, reuseable components, micro-services, writing tests (yes, you read that correctly) and bringing life to great designs. Currently, I work as a software engineer at Blizzard Entertainment.",
          "I'm also into other things: roasting coffee, music composition, drums, teaching, gaming, woodworking, beer, bread, making long lists, being a husband and father, and geeking out on life in general."
